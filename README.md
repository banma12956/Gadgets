## Fetch and sort related papers from Semantic Scholar
This code will open a local website, where you can add paper with Semantic Scholar paper ID. It will list all citations and references. You can sort the papers with two levels, including citations, released date and edges (how the listed papers are connected).

## How to run:
```
python paper_explorer.py
```
